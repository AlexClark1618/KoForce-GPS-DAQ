Description:
	This repository includes code part of a data acquisition system utilizing u-blox GNSS modules to generate nanosecond accurate timestamps from singals produced by scintillator-SiPM based surface airshower detectors. These timestamps are processed and recorded by ESP32 clients,
	only transmitting data to a central server writing the data to disk when a trigger is detected on one of three underground borehole detectors. This is an R&D project to utilize muon tomography for geological exploration. 

Collaborators:
	Jean-Luc Geaverau, Alex Clark
